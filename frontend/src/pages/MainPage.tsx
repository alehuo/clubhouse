      Many student unions across Finland use so called "clubhouses" where they
      can organize events and have fun with other students.
    </Typography>
    <Typography component="p">
      It is not always clear what events are kept there, who has the permission
      to use such places and how to keep a good track of who is in response of
      other people, and when has such a person been there.
    </Typography>
    <Typography component="p">
      This project is meant to solve this problem by providing:
      <ul>
        <li>Student union management</li>
        <li>
